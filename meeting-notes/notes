Leland - if we don't do the cable running this weekend then it will have to be next weekend.
Jeff - HFTW sets are getting approved right now. There may be trusses going up in the next few weeks. No huge expense with that, may just need to purchase a little bit of piping. Marcus's set is going to look completely different than it did last time. It's much more open.
Jeff - discussion between Audio and Jeff about Marcus's set logistics
